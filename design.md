# Design Document

## Introduction
This design document is used to organize thought, manage code, system design, etc. For CovAid AI Chatbot. With goal to provide accurate information during COVID-19 Pandemic. This is a work done during submission of 2020 CovLab Global Hackathon. If you have any question, please send an email to: [@thafiona13](mailto:fionaxiework@gmail.com) or opening an issue.

## Scenarios
This would help people to know accurate COVID-19 spread and other information quicker. One use of this is Discord bot. You could add this Bot to your discord server. So beside chatting with real people in the discord server, they can also chat with this bot. So people don't have to go to Twitter to see the "accurate" information. It would be best use during this pandemic, but maybe rewritten for future epidemic or for historical use.
